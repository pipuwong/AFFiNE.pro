File management operations should include installing security features. Organize files in folders and subfolders and categorize them based on work tasks and phases.\n\n\nGive them relevant names based on the content in them, departments, and uses. Create backups for all your files and save fewer documents on your Mac hard disk. Fewer files means your computer will have ample space to run documents and applications.\n\n\nThis increases performance to the highest level. Avoid storing documents in scattered locations because it makes retrieval processes complex. Instead, store them in one location to hasten saving and retrieval processes. Create one parent folder and several subfolders within it.\n\n\nAdd more subfolders as your documents increase but maintain a hierarchical order. Ensure your Mac storage is always clean and free from temporary files and downloads. Check your storage regularly to identify cache and temporary file buildup. Check your downloads folder for documents and files taking up space.\n\n\nIdentify applications that are no longer in use or those incompatible with your Mac. Highlight these applications, cache, downloads, and temporary files, and delete them. Once deleted, open your Trash folder because the files will be deposited there. Empty the Trash folder to free up the space occupied by these files.\n\n\nDifferent methods help you identify and remove these cluttering files from your Mac. You may do it manually but this method might take more time and leave broken files in the system. You could also make a mistake and delete files that you should not causing your computer to register files.\n\n\nAnother method is using Terminal to open specific folders and empty them. Type the command cd ~ /folder name or cd ~ /Documents to open specific documents and delete them. You can also use a third-party application to clean Mac from all clutter.\n\n\n### Use cloud solutions\n\n\nCloud solution avails your documents, databases, and whiteboards anywhere, anytime. It is useful for your digital data allowing it to be stored in multiple remote locations. Your cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the servers which eliminates the burden and cost for you.\n\n\nThese solutions are filled with top-notch security details although you should install your security walls too. You may opt for public, private, or hybrid cloud but understand the benefits of each. Cloud services improve your input/output processes which boosts performance.\n\n\nYour cloud space is available anytime from any place and can easily interconnect your remote teams. It is easy to scale to any level of space and security as long as you have the budget for it. This solution creates space for innovation and stores data near your computer ensuring higher efficiency and performance.\n\n\nApple’s iCloud is the top solution for Mac users because it is designed for Mac and other Apple devices.
