Additionally, as Evernote has expanded its offerings, some users find the app overly complex, which can hinder productivity rather than enhance it.\n\n\nFree users also face limitations, such as **syncing across only two devices**, which can be frustrating in our multi-device world. The monthly upload cap of **60MB** on the free plan can feel restrictive for those who frequently add images or attachments. While Evernote's search functionality is robust, it has limitations, particularly in searching within PDFs or handwritten notes. Furthermore, although collaboration tools have improved, they still lag behind competitors, especially for real-time teamwork.\n\n\n### The Importance of Finding the Right Note-Taking App\n\n\nChoosing the right note-taking app is crucial for several reasons:\n\n\n* **Productivity Boost**: An app that aligns with your workflow can significantly increase your efficiency and output.\n\n\n* **Organization**: The right tool helps you structure your thoughts, projects, and information in a way that makes sense to you.\n\n\n* **Accessibility**: Being able to access your notes anytime, anywhere, on any device is key in our increasingly mobile world.\n\n\n* **Integration**: An app that works well with your other tools creates a seamless productivity ecosystem.\n\n\n* **Learning Curve**: An intuitive interface reduces the time spent learning the app and increases time spent actually using it.\n\n\n* **Cost-Effectiveness**: Finding an app that offers the features you need at a price point you're comfortable with ensures long-term usability.\n\n\n* **Future-Proofing**: Choosing an app with active development and a strong user base helps ensure your note-taking system will be supported for years to come.\n\n\nAs we delve into the top [Evernote alternatives](https://affine.pro/blog/best-evernote-alternatives-and-competitors-for-note-taking) for 2025, consider your specific needs and workflow. The perfect note-taking app can transform your productivity, acting as a second brain that captures, organizes, and retrieves information exactly when you need it.\n\n\n## Top 10 Evernote Alternatives for 2025\n\n\n### [AFFiNE](https://affine.pro/download)\n\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/BytVdSmNv03ECbDFQCBEIj1S2IORcZwYnlGl_usoowE=\"\n  alt=\"AFFiNE-Evernote Alternative\"\n  width=\"auto\"\n  height=\"auto\"\n/>\nAFFiNE is an open-source, privacy-first alternative to Evernote that is rapidly gaining traction among tech-savvy users.

Hereâ€™s a comprehensive guide to help you transition successfully.\n\n\n### How to Export Notes from Evernote\n\n\nThe first step in your transition is exporting your notes from Evernote. This process is straightforward:\n\n\n1. **Open Evernote**: Start by launching the Evernote application on your desktop.\n\n\n1. **Select Your Notes**: Choose the notes or entire notebooks you wish to export. You can select multiple items by holding down the Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac) key while clicking on your desired notes.\n\n\n1. **Export Your Notes**: Navigate to the menu and click on**File**, then select **Export Notes**. Choose the appropriate format (like .enex for Evernote XML) and decide where to save the exported file.\n\n\n1. **Confirm the Export**: Finally, click**Save**to complete the export process. You now have a backup of your notes ready for import into your new app.\n\n\n### Tips for Organizing and Importing into New Apps\n\n\nAfter exporting your notes, itâ€™s time to organize and import them into your new app. Here are some tips to ensure a smooth transition:\n\n\n#### Plan Your Structure\n\n\nBefore importing, think about how you want to organize your notes in the new application. Create a structure that fits your workflowâ€”this could be based on projects, topics, or dates. A clear organization will make it easier to find and manage your notes later.\n\n\n#### Clean Up Your Notes\n\n\nUse this transition period to declutter. Review your exported notes and delete any that are outdated or irrelevant. This will simplify the import process and help you retain only the information you truly need.\n\n\n#### Use Tags and Categories\n\n\nIf the new app supports tagging or categorization, consider applying these features during or after the import. Organizing your notes with tags can enhance retrieval and make your workspace more efficient.\n\n\n#### Import Your Notes\n\n\nFollow the specific instructions for importing notes into your new app. Most applications will have an import feature that allows you to upload the .enex file or other formats.
