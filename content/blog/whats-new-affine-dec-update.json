Login Self Host Instance via Desktop App\n\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/stSURNzOP8rDm60ZLWX-rhgTVSlntpGUo18JvZ_gnH4=\"\n  alt=\"self host client\"\n  width=\"auto\"\n  height=\"auto\"\n/>\nNow you’re all set to access your self-hosted server just like how you connect to Affine Cloud with any desktop client. To get started, click “Add Server” and enter the address of your self-hosted server. This will allow you to log in seamlessly.\n\n\n### 2. Team Workspace Reveal\n\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/LuF52cddBngiSYiEoNGoxznPSszf051JDVGivIlVlkM=\"\n  alt=\"Teamwork Space\"\n  width=\"auto\"\n  height=\"auto\"\n/>\nWant a collaborative, open source and selfhostable workspace for your mission-critical work? Affine is now the only choice to go. Create or upgrade your existing workspace to team workspaces, featuring unlimited members, increased storage space, and enhanced member roles for better team collaboration.\n\n\n### \n\n\n### 3. AFFiNE AI Improvements\n\n\n<iframe\n  type=\"text/html\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"410px\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qrLqBb7SCwM\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n  allowfullscreen\n  credentialless>\n</iframe>\n\n\nPrompt anything on top of existing AI actions. An universal prompt input is now avaiable with any selected content. You can now generate presentation, mindmap and insert it automatically directly in page mode.\n\n\n<iframe\n  type=\"text/html\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"410px\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1dt_6_4po9k\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n  allowfullscreen\n  credentialless>\n</iframe>\n\n\n### \n\n\n### 4. Toggle Headings\n\n\n<iframe\n  type=\"text/html\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"410px\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oqaXjB_ROfY\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n  allowfullscreen\n  credentialless>\n</iframe>\n\n\nYou can now collapse and expand all headings directly without adding toggle headings block, making it easier to organize and navigate through your doc content.\n\n\n\n\n\n### 5. @Menu Improvements\n\n\n<iframe\n  type=\"text/html\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"410px\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RlckLreaIoo\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n  allowfullscreen\n  credentialless>\n</iframe>\n\n\nWe’ve enhanced the @Menu functionality. You can now reference today’s Journal or specify a Journal from any given date. Additionally, we’ve improved the document search capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n### 6. New Backlinks\n\n\n<iframe\n  type=\"text/html\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"410px\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ih8KBjFEczw\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n  allowfullscreen\n  credentialless>\n</iframe>\n\n\nBacklinks have long been in a rather “underdeveloped” state. We understand their critical role in bi-directional linking, so in this update, we’ve redesigned and enhanced Backlink capabilities. Now, you can see the relevant context of references directly within Backlinks, giving you more information to refer to when reviewing linked content.\n\n\n\n\n\n### 7. Single-Page Layout Customization\n\n\n<iframe\n  type=\"text/html\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"410px\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IWpFp5dFxPU\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n  allowfullscreen\n  credentialless>\n</iframe>\n\n\nCustomize page layout per page without affecting global settings—choose between Full Width and Standard Width for an optimized view or editing experience, ideal for content like Database Kanban view or Table view.\n\n\n\n\n\n### 8. Customizable Linked Document Display\n\n\n<iframe\n  type=\"text/html\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"410px\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kcpq5Z2R92o\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n  allowfullscreen\n  credentialless>\n</iframe>\n\n\nYou can now edit linked doc alias through 'edit' while maintaining references, whether it's an inline view, embed view, or linked docs within embed views. This gives you more control over how linked content appears in your docs.\n\n\n\n\n\n### 9. Lock & Selection\n\n\n<iframe\n  type=\"text/html\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"410px\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_zDkAZ5rot4\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n  allowfullscreen\n  credentialless>\n</iframe>\n\n\nLock has been one of the most requested features in the AFFiNE community, and we’ve heard you loud and clear! In 0.19, we’ve introduced the Lock feature. Now, every element on Edgeless  can be locked in place, securing both its position and state. This makes managing and organizing content on Edgeless more convenient than ever.\n\nAdditionally, Selection has long been a frustrating experience for many users. In 0.19, we’ve optimized the selection functionality on Edgeless. You no longer have to worry about accidentally selecting the Frame itself when trying to select content within it.\n\n\n\n\n\n### 10. Enhanced Sidebar-Editor Drag-and-Drop\n\n\n<iframe\n  type=\"text/html\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"410px\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MgV9dgJ1HWc\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n  allowfullscreen\n  credentialless>\n</iframe>\n\n\nYou can now drag docs from sidebar (Favorites, folders, Collections) to insert them as linked docs in the editor, and drag existing linked docs from editor to sidebar for quick organization. This feature works in both Page mode and Edgeless mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n### 11. Mind Map Improvements\n\n\n<iframe\n  type=\"text/html\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"410px\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZYBkwjxolyg\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n  allowfullscreen\n  credentialless>\n</iframe>\n\n\n**Improved mind map drag and drop**\n\n\nRebuilt drag and drop interactions to make node placement more predictable and intuitive, helping you better organize your thoughts in mind maps.\n\n\n**Collapsible mind map nodes**\n\n\nYou can now expand and collapse child nodes in mind maps, making it easier to focus and manage complex mind map structures.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
